Approach 1 (doubleL):
This one creates a regular function that makes a list of doubled numbers. It:
Makes an empty list called 'res'
Goes through numbers 0 to n-1
Multiplies each number by 2
Adds each result to the list
Finally returns the whole list at once

Approach 2:
This is a list comprehension - it's like a shortcut way to make the same list! It:
Takes numbers 0 to 4
Multiplies each by 2
Makes a list of the results all in one line
Super concise but does the same thing as Approach 1

Approach 3 (doubleG):
This one uses a generator function that:
Goes through numbers 0 to n-1
Multiplies each by 2
Instead of making a list, it "yields" each number one at a time
Only calculates each number when it's needed

ii. 
doubleG is a generator function - we can tell because it uses "yield" instead of "return".
The big advantage is memory efficiency! Instead of creating a whole list at once like the other approaches, it generates each number only when needed. This is super helpful when dealing with large sequences because it doesn't need to store everything in memory at once. Like, if you needed a million numbers, a generator would be much more memory-friendly than making a huge list!
